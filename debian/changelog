sysklogd (2.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for `logger -k`, early log to /dev/kmsg.  Useful when logging
    from early system startup scripts before syslogd has started
  * Support for extracting non-kernel log messages from /dev/kmsg
  * Ignore EINVAL from kernel, caused warning message at first startup
  * Add support for `syslogd -C file` to use `file` for caching
    the last seen kernel sequence number, default: /run/syslogd.cache
  * Fix regression from v2.2.3, causing loss of syslogd log messages
    like `syslogd v2.2.3: restart.`
  * Fix man page, listed `-v` as verbose mode, is actually version
  * Replace `\m` with `\n` (missing newline) in `logger` usage text
  * Use systemd KillMode=process
  * Let syslogd use another socket when journald is active (systemd systems)

sysklogd (2.2.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix problem with log messages stuck in 1969.  When not using libsyslog,
    or the bundled logger, the syslog() API in the C library is used, which
    may not necessarily set the timestamp.  When sysklogd infers timestamp
    it was offset by the number of years since 1969, i.e., boot_time.
  * Fix problem with repeating kernel messages if syslogd is restarted.
    This introduces a new state file, /var/run/syslogd.cache, which saves
    the last seen/logged sequence id read from `/dev/kmsg`
  * Fix log message time calculation issue on 32-bit systems.
  * Fix remote kernel messages being mapped to uucp instead of user
  * Fix man page syslogd(8), name of PID file (syslog.pid -> syslogd.pid)
